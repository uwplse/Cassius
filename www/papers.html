  <h2>OOPSLA’19: Modular Verification of Web Page Layout</h2>

    <p>Automated verification can ensure that a web page satisfies
    accessibility, usability, and design properties regardless of the
    end user's device, preferences, and assistive technologies.
    However, state-of-the-art verification tools for layout properties
    do not scale to large pages because they rely on whole-page
    analyses and must reason about the entire page using the complex
    semantics of the browser layout algorithm.</p>

    <p>This paper introduces and formalizes modular layout proofs. A
    modular layout proof splits a monolithic verification problem into
    smaller verification problems, one for each component of a web
    page. Each component specification can use rely/guarantee-style
    preconditions to make it verifiable independently of the rest of
    the page and enabling reuse across multiple pages. Modular layout
    proofs scale verification to pages an order of magnitude larger
    than those supported by previous approaches.</p>

    <p>We prototyped these techniques in a new proof assistant,
    Troika. In Troika, a proof author partitions a page into
    components and writes specifications for them. Troika then
    verifies the specifications, and uses those specifications to
    verify whole-page properties. Troika also enables the proof author
    to verify different component specifications with different
    verification tools, leveraging the strengths of each. In a case
    study, we use Troika to verify a large web page and demonstrate a
    speed-up of 13--1469x over existing tools, taking verification
    time from hours to seconds. We develop a systematic approach to
    writing Troika proofs and demonstrate it on 8 proofs of properties
    from prior work to show that modular layout proofs are short, easy
    to write, and provide benefits over existing tools.</p>

  <p>The paper explains Troika, a proof assistant built atop
  VizAssert, which allows verifying web pages piece-by-piece. The

  <h2>PLDI’18: Verifying that Web Pages have Accessible Layout</h2>

      Usability and accessibility guidelines aim to make graphical
      user interfaces accessible to all users, by, say, requiring that
      text is sufficiently large, interactive controls are visible,
      and heading size corresponds to importance. These guidelines
      must hold on the infinitely many possible renderings of a web
      page generated by differing screen sizes, fonts, and other user
      preferences. Today, these guidelines are tested by manual
      inspection of a few renderings, because 1) the guidelines are
      not expressed in a formal language, 2) the semantics of browser
      rendering are not well understood, and 3) no tools exist to
      check all possible renderings of a web page. VizAssert solves
      these problems. First, it introduces <i>visual logic</i> to
      precisely specify accessibility properties. Second, it
      formalizes a large fragment of the <i>browser rendering
      algorithm</i> using novel <i>finitization reductions</i>. Third,
      it provides a <em>sound, automated tool</em> for verifying
      assertions in visual logic.
    </p>
     
    <p>
      We encoded 14 assertions drawn from best-practice accessibility
      and mobile-usability guidelines in visual logic. VizAssert
      checked them on on 62 professionally designed web pages. It
      found 64 distinct errors in the web pages, while reporting only
      13 false positive warnings.

    formalizations of line height, margin collapsing, and floating
    boxes, and the verification tool built atop it. The paper

      Web pages define their appearance using Cascading Style Sheets, a
      modular language for layout of tree-structured documents. In
      principle, using CSS is easy: the developer specifies declarative
      constraints on the layout of an HTML document (such as the
      positioning of nodes in the HTML tree), and the browser solves the
      constraints to produce a box-based rendering of that document. In
      practice, however, the subtleties of CSS semantics make it difficult
      to develop stylesheets that produce the intended layout across
      different user preferences and browser settings.
    </p>
     
    <p>
      This paper presents the first mechanized formalization of a
      substantial fragment of the CSS semantics. This formalization is
      equipped with an efficient reduction to the theory of
      quantifier-free linear real arithmetic, enabling effective automated
      reasoning about CSS stylesheets and their behavior. We implement
      this reduction in Cassius, a solver-aided framework for building
      semantics-aware tools for CSS. To demonstrate the utility of
      Cassius, we prototype new tools for automated verification,
      debugging, and synthesis of CSS code. We show that these tools work
      on fragments of real-world websites, and that Cassius is a practical
      first step toward solver-aided programming for the web.

    The paper explains how Cassius works, the main limitations that
    make its efficient translation to SMT possible, and the various
    tools that can be built atop it. The paper is available

  <h2>FSE’16 Doctoral Symposium: Generating Interactive Web Pages from Storyboards</h2>

  <blockquote class="abstract">
    <p>
      Web design is a visual art, but web designs are code. Designers
      work visually and must then manually translate their designs to
      code. We propose using synthesis to automatically translate the
      storyboards designers already produce into CSS stylesheets and
      JavaScript code. To build a synthesis tool for this complex
      domain, we will use a novel composition mechanism that allows
      splitting the synthesis task among domain-specific solvers.
    </p>

    <p>
      We have built a domain-specific solver for CSS stylesheets;
      solvers for DOM actions and JavaScript code can be built with
      similar techniques. To compose the three domain-specific
      solvers, we propose using partial counterexamples to exchange
      information between different domains. Early results suggest
      that this composition mechanism is fast and allows specializing
      each solver to its domain.

    The paper explains the larger plans for building upon the
    OOPSLA’16 work to create a synthesizer for interactive web pages.
